    "# The static optimization\n",
    "One of the least properly named analysis in biomechanics, the static optimization is often the last step in the inverse flow in biomechanics (that is starting from the data and going back to the cause, which are the muscle activations). \n",
    "So it is basically to find which muscle activation set can explain some values found in inverse dynamics. \n",
    "\n",
    "As there are infinitely many solutions that can explain the forces, unless they want to find the answer by hand, one must perform an optimization. \n",
    "Since there is an optimization at each frame, the dynamic of the system is basically ignore (therefore the `static` in static optimization). \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will use `scipy` to perform an optimization at each frame to find the optimal set of muscle activation"
